# About Tailwind Traders

Tailwind Traders is a fictional company inspired by Northwind and Adventure Works - BUT. The goal of this project is to reflect what goes in outside the world of conference demos and tutorials, answering a simple question:

> Your tutorial/demo is great and all, but would you do in the **real world**.

## Keeping It Real

This project is brought to you by the Cloud Advocacy team at Microsoft, a team with many "industry hires" that have built systems similar to the ones you see here. 

About 3 years ago, one of the people on our team quipped:

> Any 5 of us could build a dream startup. There's a lot of great experience in this group!

Although Tailwind Traders is far beyond the startup stage, we're treating it like one. Our guiding principles are:

 - Keep it as simple as possible, until you can't
 - Always have the option to scale
 - Use the tools for what they're good at, no more
 - _Write it down_ so we know what decisions shaped the tool

Overly complex designs add friction and weight to companies that need to move fast, and that's our overriding objective: **keep it simple, Sally**!

## Building a Business on Azure

Back in the early 2000s the ASP.NET team released a series of "Starter Kits" that helped developers get off the ground with ASP.NET. These little kits turned out to be pretty well-made, and one of them served as the foundation for a very successful company called [Dotnet Nuke](https://www.dnnsoftware.com/).

That's one of our goals: to help you build something using Azure. We've assembled little "verticals", as we like to call them, that you can arrange as you need and expand when required.

They are:

 - A simple Markdown CMS
 - An eCommerce product catalog
 - An eCommerce sales processor (using Stripe)
 - A blog engine powered by Markdown
 - A digital fulfillment service
 - A Job Queue which is used by these other services
 - A transactional email service with mailing list features

We might add to these in the future, but this is what we're building now.

## Powered by ASP.NET Minimal API

Each of these services is built using ASP.NET Minimal API, and while they might resemble microservices, that's not the architectural goal. In fact, you could, if you wanted, combine these projects into a single solution and they would work together just fine.

These projects are only a starting point - what you build on top of them is up to you and your vision.

Instead of deploying your code to Azure, **deploy a business**!
