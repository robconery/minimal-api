# The Svelte Starter Template

This is the starter template for ASP.NET and Svelte, which will hopefully get you off the ground quickly. Further instructions for how to use this template are in `templates/README.md`.

To install this template, simply:

```sh
dotnet new install Svelte.Web.Starter
```

Which will allow you to:

```sh
dotnet new svelte
```

## Documentation and Help

There are READMEs throughout the codebase and, hopefully, enough to go on there. At the end of the day it's a Minimal API + Svelte application and you can find links to the documentation for those in the READMEs.

## Questions?

I haven't created a discussion board for this app just yet but I can if people are interested. Otherwise feel free to leave an issue.
