# The Vue Starter Template

If you're a Vue fan, this template will hopefully get you off the ground quickly. Further instructions for how to use this template are in the README for the template itself.

To install this template, simply:

```sh
dotnet new install Vue.Web.Starter
```

Which will allow you to:

```sh
dotnet new vue
```

## Documentation and Help

There are READMEs throughout the codebase and, hopefully, enough to go on there. At the end of the day it's a Minimal API + Vue 3 application and you can find links to the documentation for those in the READMEs.

## Questions?

I haven't created a discussion board for this app just yet but I can if people are interested. Otherwise feel free to leave an issue.
